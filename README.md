### Project-Straw is a Bash script that automates the WPS Pixie Dust attack for you

Using it is simple, run the command
```
sudo straw.sh
```

It will ask you to plug in a wifi adapter and press enter
> [!NOTE]
> the script will use ***wlan1mon*** when set in monitor mode, if yours is different, change the name in ***lines 47 & 60***

It will automatically scan for WPS devices, once ready hit ***CTRL+C*** and enter the ***BSSID and Channel #***

Then let it do it's work :)
